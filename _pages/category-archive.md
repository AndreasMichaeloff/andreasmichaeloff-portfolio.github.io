Currently a Data Science and Analytics intern at Trane Technologies, with skills in Python, SQL, Excel, Tableau, and Power BI. I thrive on solving challenging business problems, and making sure every possible question is answered. 

Over the summer of 2025, I have enjoyed leading several impactful projects within Trane Technologies, with the main goals of streamlining reporting processes and providing valuable insights to the company as well as its customers.

I'm passionate about uncovering stories within data and enjoy leveraging team work to tackle problems in different ways. Outside of analytics, I love playing soccer, exploring nature, and creating music.
